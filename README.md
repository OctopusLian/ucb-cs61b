# UCB CS 61B  

[CS 61B Data Structures, Fall 2022](https://fa22.datastructur.es/)  

In 61A, the correctness of a program was our primary goal.   
In CS 61B, we're concerned also with engineering.   
An engineer, it is said, is someone who can do for a dime what any fool can do for a dollar.   
Much of 61B will be concerned with the tradeoffs in time and memory for a variety of methods for structuring data.   
We'll also be concerned with the engineering knowledge and skills needed to build and maintain moderately large programs.
